.# Abstract

This specification defines an extension of OpenID Connect to allow holders to request issuance and issuers of verifiable credentials issuance of verifiable credentials.

{mainmatter}

# Introduction

This specification extends OpenID Connect with support for issuance of verifiable credentials, e.g. in the form of W3C Verifiable Credentials. This allows existing OpenID Connect OPs to extends their service and become credential issuer. It also allows new applications built using Verifiable Credentials to utilize OpenID Connect as integration and interoperability layer between credential holders and issuers. 

# Use Cases

## Holder initiated credential issuance

A user comes across an app where she needs to present a credential, e.g. a bank identity credential. She starts the flow presentation flow at this app and is sent to her wallet (e.g. via SIOP v2 and OpenID Connect 4 Verifiable Presentations). The wallet determines the desired credential type(s) from the request and notifies the user that there is currently no matching credential in the wallet. The wallet now offers the user a list of suitable issuers, which might be based on an issuer list curated by the wallet publisher. The user picks one of those issuers and is sent to the issuers user experience (web site or app). There the user authenticates and is asked for consent to issuer the required credential into her wallet. She consents and is sent back to the wallet, where she is informed that a credential was sucessfully created and stored in the wallet.

## Holder initiated credential issuance (with pre-requisites)

A user comes across an app where she needs to present a credential, e.g. an university diploma. She starts the flow presentation flow at this app and is sent to her wallet (e.g. via SIOP v2 and OpenID Connect 4 Verifiable Presentations). The wallet determines the desired credential type(s) from the request and notifies the user that there is currently no matching credential in the wallet. The wallet now offers the user a list of suitable issuers, which might be based on an issuer list curated by the wallet publisher. The user picks one of those issuers and is notified that the issuer requires an identity credential as pre-requisite for issuance of the diploma. The wallet also offers to send the existing bank identity credential to the issuer for that purpose. The user confirms and is sent to the issuers user experience (web site or app). The issuer evaluates the bank identity credential, looks up the user in its database, finds her diploma and offers to issue a verifiable credential. The user consents and is sent back to the wallet, where she is informed that a diploma verifiable credential was sucessfully created and stored in the wallet.

## Issuer initiated credential issuance

The user browses her university's home page, searching for a way to obtain a digital diploma. She finds the respective page, which shows a link "request your digital diploma". She clicks on this link and is being sent to her digital wallet. The wallet notfies her that an issuer offered to issue an credential of type "diploma". She confirms this inquiry and is being sent to the university's credential issuance service. She logs with her university login and is being asked to consent to the creation of a digital diploma. She confirms and is sent back to her wallet. There she is notified of the sucessful creation of the digital diploma.  

## Issuer initiated credential issuance (cross device/ credential retrival only)

The user visits the administration office of her university in order to obtain a digital diploma. The university staff checks her student card and looks up her university diploma in the universities IT system. The office staff then starts the issuance process. The user is asked to scan a QR Code in order to retrieve the digital diploma. She scans the code with her smartphone, which automatically starts her wallet, where she is being notified of the offer to create a digital diploma (the verifiable credential). She consents, which causes the wallet to obtain and store the verifiable credential. 

## Deferred Credential Issuance

The user wants to obtain a digital criminal record certificate. She starts the journey in her wallet and is sent to the issuer service of the responsible government authority. She logs in with her eID and requests the issuance of the certificate. She is being notified that the issuance of the certificate will take a couple of days due to necessary background checks by the authority. She confirms and is sent back to the wallet. The wallet shows a hint in the credential list indicating that issuance of the digital criminal record certificate is under way. A few days later, she receives an e-Mail from the authority that the certificate was sucessfully issued. She visits her wallet, where she is asked after startup whether she wants to download the certificate. She confirms and the new credential is retrieved and stored in her wallet. 

# Terminology

Credential

A set of one or more claims made by an issuer. (see [@VC_DATA])

Verifiable Credential (VC)

A verifiable credential is a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified. Verifiable credentials can be used to build verifiable presentations, which can also be cryptographically verified. The claims in a credential can be about different subjects. (see [@VC_DATA])

Presentation

Data derived from one or more verifiable credentials, issued by one or more issuers, that is shared with a specific verifier. (see [@VC_DATA])

Verified Presentation (VP)

A verifiable presentation is a tamper-evident presentation encoded in such a way that authorship of the data can be trusted after a process of cryptographic verification. Certain types of verifiable presentations might contain data that is synthesized from, but do not contain, the original verifiable credentials (for example, zero-knowledge proofs). (see [@VC_DATA])

W3C Verifiable Credential Objects

Both verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations

# Overview 

This specification defines mechanisms to allow RPs to request and OPs to provide Verifiable Presentations via OpenID Connect. 

Verifiable Presentations are used to present claims along with cryptographic proofs of the link between presenter and subject of the verifiable credentials it contains. A verifiable presentation can contain a subset of claims asserted in a certain credential (selective disclosure) and it can assemble claims from different credentials. 

There are two credential formats to VCs and VPs: JSON or JSON-LD. There are also two proof formats to VCs and VPs: JWT and Linked Data Proofs. Each of those formats has different properties and capabilites and each of them comes with different proof types. Proof formats are agnostic to the credential format chosen. However, the JSON credential format is commonly used with JSON Web Signatures (see [@VC_DATA], section 6.3.1). JSON-LD is commonly used with different kinds of Linked Data Proofs and JSON Web Signatures (see [@VC_DATA], section 6.3.2). Applications can use all beforementioned assertion and proof formats with this specification. 

This specification introduces the following representations to exchange verifiable credentials objectes between OpenID OPs and RPs.

* The new token type "VP Token" used as generic container for verifiable presentation objects in authentication and token responses in addition to ID Tokens (see (#vp_token)).
* The JWT claim `verifiable_presentations` used as generic container to embed verifiable presentation objects into ID tokens or userinfo responses (see (#verifiable_presentations)).

Verifiers request verifiable presentations using the `claims` parameter as defined in (@!OpenID) and syntax as defined in DIF Presentation Exchange [@!DIF.PresentationExchange].

# vp_token {#vp_token}

The response parameter `vp_token` is defined as follows:

* `vp_token`: a parameter that either directly contains a verifiable presentation or it contains a JSON array with multiple verifiable presentations. 

## Request

A VP Token is requested by adding a new top level element `vp_token` to the `claims` parameter. This element contains a `presentation_definition` element as defined in Section 4 of [@!DIF.PresentationExchange].

Please note this draft defines a profile of [@!DIF.PresentationExchange] as follows: 

* The `format` element underneath the `presentation_definition` that represents supported presentation formats, proof types, and algorithms is not supported. Those are determined using new RP and OP metadata (see (#metadata)). 

The request syntax is illustrated in the following example:

<{{examples/request/vp_token_type_only.json}}

This simple example requests the presentation of a credential of a certain type. 

The following example

<{{examples/request/vp_token_type_and_claims.json}}

shows how the RP can request selective dislosure or certain claims from a credential of a particular type. 

RPs can also ask for alternative credentials being presented, which is shown in the next example:

<{{examples/request/vp_token_alternative_credentials.json}}

## Response

A `vp_token` MUST be provided in the same response as the `id_token` of the respective OpenID Connect transaction. Depending on the response/grant type, this can be either the authentication response or the token response. 

The corresponding ID Token will always contain an element `_vp_token` containing additional metadata about the verifiable presentation(s) in the VP token. This element is defined as follows;

`_vp_token`: JWT claim containing an element of type `presentation_submission`. This `presentation_submission` element links the input descriptor identifiers as specified in the corresponding request to the respective verifiable presentations within the `vp_token` along with format information. The root of the path expressions in the descriptor map is the respective `vp_token`. 

In case the OP returns a single verifiable presentation in the `vp_token`, the `vp_token` MUST directly contain the verifiable presentation. The descriptor map would then contain a simple path expression "$".

This is an example of a `vp_token` containing a single verifiable presentation:

<{{examples/response/vp_token_raw_ldp_vp.json}}

The respective `id_token` is:

<{{examples/response/id_token_ref_vp_token.json}}

A `descriptor_map` element MAY also contain a `path_nested` element refering to the actual credential carried in the respective verifiable presentation. 

In case the OP returns multiple verifiable presentations in a `vp_token`, the `vp_token` MUST contain a JSON array, where every element is a verifiable presentation. 

Here is an example of such a `vp_token`:  

<{{examples/response/vp_token_multiple_vps.json}}

And here is the respective `id_token`:

<{{examples/response/id_token_ref_vp_token_multple_vps.json}}

Note: Authentication event information is conveyed via the id token while it's up to the RP to determine what (additional) claims are allocated to `id_token` and `vp_token`, respectively, via the `claims` parameter.  

# verifiable_presentations {#verifiable_presentations}

The claim `verifiable_presentations` is defined as follows:

- `verifiable_presentations`:  A claim whose value is an array of verifiable presentations.

This claim can be added to ID Tokens, Userinfo responses as well as Access Tokens and Introspection response. It MAY also be included as aggregated or distributed claims (see Section 5.6.2 of the OpenID Connect specification [OpenID]).

Note that above claim has to be distinguished from `vp` or `vc` claims as defined in [JWT proof format](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json-web-token). `vp` or `vc` claims contain those parts of the standard verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations where no explicit encoding rules for JWT exist. They are used as part of a verifiable credential or presentation in JWT format. They are not meant to include complete verifiable credentials or verifiable presentations objects which is the purpose of the claims defined in this specification.

## Request

Verifiable Presentations are requested by embedding a `verifiable_presentations` element containing a `presentation_definition` following the profile defined in (#vp_token) to the `id_token` (or `userinfo`) top level element of the `claims` parameter. 

Here is a non-normative example: 

<{{examples/request/id_token_type_only.json}}

## Response

In response to a request es specfied above, the OP MUST add all matching verifiable presentations to the `verifiable_presentations` claims in the artifact as request (ID token or Userinfo response). 

Additional metadata about the verifiable presentations is provided in an additional `presentation_submission` element as defined in [@!DIF.PresentationExchange] in the same artifact. This `presentation_submission` element links the input descriptor identifiers as specified in the corresponding request to the respective verifiable presentations within the `verifiable_presentations` along with format information as shown in the following example:

<{{examples/response/id_token_jwt_vp.json}}

The root of the path expressions in the descriptor map is the respective JSON documemnt, such as ID token or Userinfo response. 

# Metadata {#metadata}

This specification introduces additional metadata to enable RP and OP to determine the verifiable presentation formats, proof types and algorithms to be used in a protocol exchange. 

## RP Metadata

This specification defines new client metadata parameters according to [@!OpenID.Registration].

RPs indicate the suported formats using the new parameter `vp_formats`.

* `vp_formats`: an object defining the formats, proof types and algorithms a RP supports. The is based on the definition of the `format` elememt in a `presentation_definition` as defined in [@!DIF.PresentationExchange] with the supported formats `jwt_vp` and `ldp_vp`.

Here is an example for a RP registering with a Standard OP via dynamic client registration:

<{{examples/client_metadata/client_code_format.json}}

Here is an example for a RP registering with a SIOP (see [@SIOPv2]) with the `registration` request parameter:

<{{examples/client_metadata/client_siop_format.json}}

## OP Metadata

This specification defines new server metadata parameters according to [@!OpenID-Discovery].

The OP publishes the formats it supports using the `vp_formats` metadata parameter as defined above in its "openid-configuration". 

# Security Considerations {#security_considerations}

To prevent replay attacks, verifiable presentation container objects MUST be linked to `client_id` and if provided `nonce` from the Authentication Request. The `client_id` is used 
to detect presentation of credentials to a different than the intended party. The `nonce` value binds the presentation to a certain authentication transaction and allows
the verifier to detect injection of a presentation in the OpenID Connect flow, which is especially important in flows where the presentation is passed through the front channel. 

The values are passed through unmodified from the Authentication Request to the verifiable presentations. 

Note: These values MAY be represented in different ways (directly as claims or indirectly be incoporation in proof calculation) according to the selected proof format denated by the format claim in the verifiable presentation container.

Here is a non-normative example for format=`jwt_vp` (only relevant part):

```json
{
  "iss": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
  "jti": "urn:uuid:3978344f-8596-4c3a-a978-8fcaba3903c5",
  "aud": "s6BhdRkqt3",
  "nonce": "343s$FSFDa-",
  "nbf": 1541493724,
  "iat": 1541493724,
  "exp": 1573029723,
  "vp": {
    "@context": [
      "<https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",>
      "<https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1">
    ],
    "type": ["VerifiablePresentation"],

    "verifiableCredential": [""]
  }
}
```

In the example above, `nonce` is included as the `nonce` and `client_id` as the `aud` value in the proof of the verifiable presentation.

Here is a non-normative example for format=`ldp_vp` (only relevant part):

```json
{
  "@context": [ ... ],
  "type": "VerifiablePresentation",
  "verifiableCredential": [ ... ],
  "proof": {
    "type": "RsaSignature2018",
    "created": "2018-09-14T21:19:10Z",
    "proofPurpose": "authentication",
    "verificationMethod": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21#keys-1",    
    "challenge": "343s$FSFDa-",
    "domain": "s6BhdRkqt3",
    "jws": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImI2NCI6ZmFsc2UsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il19..kTCYt5
      XsITJX1CxPCT8yAV-TVIw5WEuts01mq-pQy7UJiN5mgREEMGlv50aqzpqh4Qq_PbChOMqs
      LfRoPsnsgxD-WUcX16dUOqV0G_zS245-kronKb78cPktb3rk-BuQy72IFLN25DYuNzVBAh
      4vGHSrQyHUGlcTwLtjPAnKb78"
  }
}
```

In the example above, `nonce` is included as the `challenge` and `client_id` as the `domain` value in the proof of the verifiable presentation.

#### vp_token content

This is the example `vp_token` containg a verifiable presentation (and credential) in LD Proof format. 

Note: in accordance with (#security_considerations) the verifiable presentation's `challenge` claim is set to the value of the `nonce` request parameter value and the `domain` claim contains the RP's `client_id`.
